It is shown from my image that the app and code adequately provides an auto-margin after 900px 
If you still have an issue with this, send a screen capture, and detailed instructions on how to re-create your observence.

Service Worker Notes and Offline Capability: Works but there is a visible warning/error in the console log
--------------------------
Service Worker was verified to work offline and store/retrieve the cache properly
There is a known bug/issue with the service worker trying to store/retrieve the google maps api resources and neither my mentor or any other mobile web students or help on slack is able to help me with solutions to get rid of the warning that is visible only in the console log and only when the service worker is operating in offline mode. They say this should be ignored. Also, I have tried to catch this error/warning in every place in the code but it did not resolve the error/warning. There is no fix for this issue and it needs to be ignored in the grading rubric.
